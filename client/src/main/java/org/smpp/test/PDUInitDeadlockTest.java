/**
 * Reproducible demonstration of bug #1029141. PDU was instantiating subclasses
 * of itself during (synchronized) class initialisation. A race condition
 * existed whereby, say, two threads would try to instantiate two different
 * subclasses of PDU. One thread (X) would get the lock on subclass A, and then
 * on PDU.class (following the constructor hierarchy). Another thread (Y) would
 * seemingly get the lock on its own target subclass (B). Thread X would then
 * try to construct B via static initialisation, causing a deadlock.
 * 
 * Being related to initialisation, this deadlock would likely be experienced by
 * users (if at all) only at JVM startup time, and then only under certain
 * conditions, and perhaps also intermittently.
 * 
 * Solved via:
 * 
 * @see org.smpp.pdu.PDUFactory
 * 
 * @author Paolo Campanella, BulkSMS.com.
